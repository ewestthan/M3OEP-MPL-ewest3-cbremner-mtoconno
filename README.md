This program was designed to factor a user chosen number, and incorporates a Java graphical user interface. The two main files, factorGUI.java and Factoring.cpp. factorGUI.java creates a GUI window which prompts the user to enter an integer to be factored. factorGUI.java then passes this number as a string to Factoring.cpp, which converts it to an int, determines all of its factors, and returns them to factorGUI.java in a string, separated by spaces. factorGUI.java then displays the resulting factors in another GUI.
